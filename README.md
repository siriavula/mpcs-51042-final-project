# Python Programming Final Project

## I would like to create a Weather Application to help individuals view what the weather is like in the area they live in. 
- Using the Weather API, I will create an API key to gather specific weather data. 
- I will take in the person’s desired location and give them forecasts for weather and current weather data. 
- I will provide historical data for users to view past weather to get an idea of what weather will be like during that time of year.
- Users will be able to view data for any city, and I will provide a user-friendly way for them to save and view multiple cities’ weather data.
## I will start by getting the Weather API connections set up in order to display this data for the users to view information on the weather. I will use Flask to create this project.

## Example Execution Plan:
- By the end of Week 4/Week 5: set up my web application and get my API key; if this API does not work for my needs, I will try to find another weather API to get access to this data for my application
- By the end of Week 6: Implement the methods that return weather data, including forecast and current weather, for a specific location
- By the end of Week 7: Implement the methods that gives historical data for a given city and allow for users to save and view multiple cities’ weather data 
- By the end of Week 8: Launch a local web app where people can use my Weather application and troubleshoot and debug any bugs
- By the end of Week 9: Users should be able to use my Weather application!
